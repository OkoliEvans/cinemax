Cinemax is a React JS app that fetches data from an external database via an API and renders the 
data on the app.

Fetched data are stored in local storage... although I will move it to indexdb in a few days.

The movies onClick do not play as I have not worked towards playing them on the app... future works, definitely.

This is a learning project... Thanks to Sangam on Udemy
